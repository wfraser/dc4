dc token vocabulary
===================

# Implementations
1. `cherry`: the original version by Lorinda Cherry (as described by 7th Edition Unix man page, 1985)
2. `gnu`
3. `bsd`: by Otto Moerbeek
5. `gavin`: Gavin Howard's version, present on macOS since Ventura

Currently, dc4 implements the GNU set.
